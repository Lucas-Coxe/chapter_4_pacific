               <dt> What is a Yurt?</dt>
               <dd> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                   the ground. Each Yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof
                   dome that can be opened, and a private deck.
               </dd>
               <dt> How are yurts furnished?</dt>
               <dd>
                   Each yrt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed
                   with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table, and chairs, 
                   mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping
                   experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
                   and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

               <dt> What should I bring?</dt>
               <dd>
                   Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
                   for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also 
                   helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
